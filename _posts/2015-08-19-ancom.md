An Anarcho-Communist (AnCom) is one who believes that capitalism is a form of
government, by which one individual can hold power over another with the
magical powers of money.  In all reality, it's an overzealous form of anarchism
that ends up eliminating everything until all that's left is a mob of angry
communists... Kinda' like what the Bolsheviks achieved.
