A retort in response to a variation on the fallacy of the illicit affirmative,
in which the statist argues:

> {{ page.excerpt }}

Evidence of the flaw in the statist's argument comes in the form of a few
counterexamples from the private sector:

* Neftlix
* The Village VidioT

If there is a demand for something, the free market *will* provide.
