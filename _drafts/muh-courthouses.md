A retort in response to a variation on the fallacy of the illicit affirmative, in which the statist argues:

> {{ page.excerpt }}

The statist's argument is hilarious because it assumes people in a Voluntaryist society would build statist temples of violence (a.k.a. courthouses) in order to subjugate each other.

#### But seriously, who *would* build the courthouses?

Voluntaryist anarchists believe that every interaction must be one of non-coerction. Since state courts are fundamentally coercive, we must necessarily argue for a different form of dispute resolution.  Enter mediation agreements, and argument mediation. The idea here is that before entering into a contract, first both parties would agree to have any disputes resolved by a pre-arranged neutral third party.
