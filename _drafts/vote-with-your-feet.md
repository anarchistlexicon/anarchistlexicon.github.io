>See: [Argumentum ad Somalium](/argumentum-ad-somalium)
>One item of note: the phrase "vote with your feet" equivocates the act of voting with the act of opting-out.  
This is a weak comparison, as voting is the initiation or threat of violence to enforce an opinion, whereas 
leaving is (presumably) a non-violent opting out of said opinions.
