"Suspension of Statism" is a variation on the literary term "Suspension of
Disbelief".  Suspension of statism is the admission some anarchists must make
to enjoy a film or other work of art which glorifies the violence of the
state.

Where one would have to provisionally suspend one's dusbelief in hyperdrive,
lightsabers, and the force to watch and enjoy Star Wars, one would have
to suspend one's disbelief in the authority of the state in a similar
manner in order to enjoy a movie such as any of the Bond films.
