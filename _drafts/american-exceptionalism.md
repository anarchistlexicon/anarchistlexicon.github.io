<p>American exceptionalism once meant "Hell, yeah! We are the best country in the world! Because, freedom, capitalism, and apple pie."  
Due to a gradual shift in our culture and the loss of exceptional levels of freedom and market strength,
this concept of "American Exceptionalism" now more closesly resembles the logical fallacy of "special pleading",
by which one indicates that a particular instance is an exception to a coetegorical rule, without justification.</p>
<p>It now means that:</p>
<p>"It's not socialism when **we** regulate, tax, and manipulate the economy."</p>
<p>"It's not fascism when **we** wage perpetual wars of occupation and proxy wars for over a century."</p>
<p>"It's not terrorism when **we** blow up weddings, schools, funerals, and public streets in order to push a political agenda."
etc.</p>
