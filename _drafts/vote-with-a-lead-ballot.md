>A possible response to the suggestion that you should [Vote With Your Feet](/vote-with-your-feet).
>This phrase introduces a more intelelctually honest juxtaposition between voting and another possible action.
In the case of "Vote with your feet," it equivocates the initiation of violence with a non-violent opting out of a particular system.
By retorting with "Vote with a lead ballot," one indicates that one possibile solution to the state initiating force against oneself
is to, in fact, return fire.  While not all anarchists can morally support the use of lethal force in self-defense, 
it has certainly been shown effective throughout history.
