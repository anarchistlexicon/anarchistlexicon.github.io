Theft via inflation.

This is a play on the phrase "Quantatative Easing" which describes a monetary
policy where a central bank purchases governmnet securities in order to lower
interest rates and increase money supply, thereby "stimulating" the economy.

This is theft because it gives easy access to capital to the banks by diluting
the purchasing power of everyone else's money.
